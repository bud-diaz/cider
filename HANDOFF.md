# Handoff

Persistent state for the "Close Stage 1, ship Stage 2" implementation plan
(saved at plan time as `/root/.claude/plans/creat-a-plan-to-parallel-castle.md`
in the planning session; the milestone IDs below refer to that plan's
sections). Read this in full before starting a milestone. Update it —
Status, Done, Deviations, Open issues, Conformance IDs — before ending a
session, whether or not the milestone finished.

## Status

Part A (Stage 1 close-out) is done. Next up: **B1** (Image node), then
B2 → B9 in the order given in the plan. B2 (bounded layout + clipping)
and B3 (host keyboard/scroll events) are prerequisites for B4–B6 — do not
start those out of order.

Note: `swift` is not installed in the container this work was done in, so
none of this has been build/test-verified locally. CI (A1) is the first
real verification it will get — check its result before trusting any of
Part A or starting B1 on top of it.

## Done

- **A1** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Ubuntu 24.04 container
  (`swift:6.0-noble`), matrix over debug/release, installs the documented
  apt packages, starts Xvfb, runs `swift build`/`swift test` per
  configuration.
- **A2** — sandbox data roots + log redaction:
  - `SandboxPaths` (`runtime/Sources/CiderCore/SandboxPaths.swift`):
    Foundation-free struct naming `documents`/`cache`/`temporary` under a
    root string.
  - `SandboxPathResolver` (`compiler-support/Sources/CiderProject/SandboxPathResolver.swift`):
    resolves `$XDG_DATA_HOME/cider/apps/<appID>` (falling back to
    `~/.local/share/...`), validates `appID` via
    `ManifestParser.isValidAppID` before touching the filesystem, creates
    `Documents`/`Cache`/`tmp` under it. `dataRoot`/`prepare` both take an
    `environment: [String: String]` override parameter so tests don't
    touch real process environment.
  - `LaunchDescriptor.sandboxDataRoot: String` (default `""`) carries the
    resolved root from `RunCommand` to the app process; `RuntimeContext.sandbox: SandboxPaths?`
    is `nil` when empty (i.e. binary not started through `cider run`).
  - `LogRedaction.redact(_:)` + `RedactingLogSink`
    (`runtime/Sources/CiderCore/LogRedaction.swift`): word-scanning
    (no regex, so CiderCore stays Foundation-free) redaction of
    `key=value`/`key: value` pairs whose key looks like a credential, and
    the token after `Bearer`. Wired into `CiderApp.main()` wrapping
    `StandardOutputLogSink`.
  - Tests: `tests/unit/SandboxPathResolverTests.swift`,
    `tests/unit/LogRedactionTests.swift`, an added round-trip case in
    `tests/unit/LaunchDescriptorTests.swift`, and an end-to-end check in
    `tests/integration/ProjectIntegrationTests.swift`
    (`testTheSandboxRootPreparedByRunReachesTheApplication`).
  - `README.md` roadmap table and "Current limitations" updated to match.

## Deviations

- The plan suggested putting sandbox path resolution "alongside
  `RuntimeContext`" (CiderCore) or in CiderProject. Went with CiderProject
  for the actual filesystem work (`SandboxPathResolver`, using
  `FileManager`), since CiderCore deliberately has zero Foundation
  dependency (see `StandardStreams.swift`) and CiderRuntime doesn't import
  Foundation either. Only the plain-data `SandboxPaths` struct (root +
  three computed subpaths, no I/O) lives in CiderCore. The resolved root
  crosses the CLI-to-runtime process boundary as a new string field on the
  existing `LaunchDescriptor` wire format, the same way permissions
  already do.
- Log redaction does not use `NSRegularExpression`/Foundation `Regex` —
  implemented as manual word-scanning so it could live in CiderCore next
  to `Logger`. If it turns out to need more sophisticated matching later,
  that's a reason to revisit, not a correctness bug in what's there now.
- `AppPermissions` enforcement itself was explicitly left undone per the
  plan's scoping call — only capability *declaration* + the sandbox root
  exist. This was already true before A2 and remains true; Stage 3's
  services are what will consult `RuntimeContext.permissions`.

## Open issues

- CI has not actually run yet (no push has happened from this session at
  time of writing) — first real signal on whether `swift:6.0-noble` is a
  valid tag and whether the workflow is otherwise correct comes from its
  first run.

## Conformance IDs assigned so far

Existing, before this plan started (see
`tests/conformance/ConformanceTests.swift` header comment for the
authoritative list):
- `APP-LAUNCH-001`, `UI-TEXT-001`, `UI-VSTACK-001`, `UI-BUTTON-001`,
  `INPUT-POINTER-001`, `STATE-UPDATE-001`

Reserved by this plan, not yet implemented:
- `UI-IMAGE-001` (B1)
- `UI-SCROLL-001` (B4)
- `UI-TEXTFIELD-001` (B5)
- `UI-LIST-001` (B6)
- `NAV-PUSH-001`, `NAV-POP-001` (B7)
- `UI-MODAL-001` (B8)
